CHANGES (newest first):

--- 2014-02-04 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE: New version number! it's now version 3.7.3, so people can differ between my branch
and the official 3.7.2 branch.

CHANGE: Multiple load balancing pool information 
The lines "Connected to multiple pools .." and best share have been replaced with a new
display for setups with load balancing and multiple pools.

The display now shows information for up to four pools;
* pool name or just pool number
* coin diff (D:)
* accepted shares (A:)
* rejected shares (R:)
* disconnects (DC:)

CHANGE: Increase readability and space usage by replacing first horizontal ruler with help
text (color coding imported from bfgminer), removing empty line and reordering status lines,
fix compact mode output.

CHANGE: Add uptime information to the first status line.

CHANGE:  Marquee removed
Vergo's uptime counter replaced the need for the marquee.

--- 2014-02-01 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE:  Idle state for GPUs when there's no work.
gpu-engine and gpu-memclock exit values are applied when there's no work available. This should
prevent overclocked devices from going unstable when a pool goes down for a longer duration.

FIX:  Comma separated gpu-thread code enabled properly.
It is now enabled when USE_SCRYPT is true, rather than bound to HAVE_ADL.

FIX: Save config code now store gpu-threads too. 

CHANGE:  Work unit efficiency added to ncurses display
It's a percentage display showing the value of (work units / average hashrate) * 100, at the
request of Marko.


--- 2014-01-30 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIX: Save config code updated.
Saving configuration now supports xintensity, rawintensity, cl-filename, gpu engine and
memclock exit/disabled values, through both ncurses interface and API. Shaders setting is also
being ignored if it is set to zero - first device setting tested only.

Additionally save config function does not save the kernel setting is disabled if scrypt is set
to true. This prevents the following issue:
https://github.com/Kalroth/cgminer-3.7.2-kalroth/issues/6


--- 2014-01-24 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE: gpu-engine and gpu-memclock exit values are now applied when disabling a device. This
goes for both the ncurses interface and through the api.


--- 2014-01-23 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: Device specific kernel .cl file.
It is now possible to set different .cl files per GPU device through the --cl-filename
parameter, and comma separated values are of course supported!

Example of usage:
  "cl-filename" : "scrypt6970,scryptR9290",

NOTE: Do NOT include the file extension in the name!


--- 2014-01-22 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: --rawintensity option, by request of Dead2.
This setting allows to set the GPU intensity value directly without any modifiers, it does not
get any more raw than this! Look at the xintensity description raw for examples of regular
intensity values. You can also set this value through the ncurses interface by pressing:
G -> A -> select device id -> enter value.

Minor xintensity code cleanup as well.

MINOR CHANGE: Support for cgwatchers pool name setting.
--name and --poolname now acts identically.

CLEANUP: Changed more messages after pool naming feature.

NEW: Failover pool switching back delay is now configurable.
--failover-switch-delay sets the delay in seconds before switching back to a failed pool,
default is 60 seconds.


--- 2014-01-19 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE: xintensity can now be set through the interface.
Press G, X, select your device ID and enter a value between 1 and 9999.

Thanks to veox of sgminer for the code:
  http://github.com/veox/sgminer/commit/463668b8789521693ad90065115906f0ee53deb8

MINOR CHANGE, API: Added two more decimal places to MH/s.


--- 2014-01-18 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAJOR CHANGE, EXPERIMENTAL: A new way of setting intensity; introducing xintensity!
All of this is credited to ArGee of RGMiner, he did the initial ground work for this setting.

This new setting allows for a much finer grained intensity setting and also opens up for dual
gpu threads on devices not previously able to. Note: make sure to use lower thread-concurrency
values when you increase cpu threads.

Intensity is currently used to spawn GPU threads as a simple 2^value setting.
  I:13 =    8192 threads
  I:15 =   32768 threads
  I:17 =  131072 threads
  I:18 =  262144 threads
  I:19 =  524288 threads
  I:20 = 1048576 threads
Notice how the higher settings increase thread count tremendously.

Now enter the xintensity setting (Yes, I am a genius with my naming convention!).
It is simply a shader multiplier, obviously based on the amount of shaders you got on a card,
this should allow the same value to scale with different card models.
   6970 with 1536 shaders: xI:64 = 98304 threads
R9 280X with 2048 shaders: xI:64 = 131072 threads
 R9 290 with 2560 shaders: xI:64 = 180224 threads
R9 290X with 2816 shaders: xI:64 = 163840 threads

   6970 with 1536 shaders: xI:300 = 460800 threads
R9 280X with 2048 shaders: xI:300 = 614400 threads
 R9 290 with 2560 shaders: xI:300 = 768000 threads
R9 290X with 2816 shaders: xI:300 = 844800 threads

It's now much easier to control thread intensity and it potentially allows for a uniform way
of setting the intensity on your system. I'm very interested in constructive feedback, as I
do not have access to a lot of different card models.

This change has been tested on 6970, R9 290, R9 290X - all with equal or better speeds than
regular intensity setting after a little tuning, but your mileage may vary. Don't fret it, if
this doesn't work for you, the regular intensity setting is still available.


--- 2014-01-18 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE: Block poolname now next to block diff.
Previously top status display had a line with random block information; few digits from previous
block, block difficulty, block start and best share. The block digits have been removed and
pool name is shown instead.

MAJOR CHANGE: Stratum servers can now be named.
The names will be used throughout the display in the program, when not set "Pool 1" will
simply be used instead. The names are not exposed through API yet, it's on my TODO list.

Use "poolname" like this:

	{
		"poolname" : "Example pool",
		"url" : "stratum+tcp://example.com:8080",
		"user" : "y",
		"pass" : "x"
	},

MINOR CHANGE: A --more-notices option has been added.
Work restart and new block notices are now hidden by default, so you need to use this option
to enable them. I might throw more notices in under this catch-all setting later.

--- 2014-01-17 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGFIX: Device rejection percentage wanders over time.
It was using the width of accepted shares in the text formatting.


--- 2014-01-10 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE:  Added BIOS information to --ndevs|-n listing.
This will aid people identifying cards in setups with different cards within the same series,
eg. 7950 and 7970s, or 290 and 290Xs.


--- 2014-01-09 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MINOR CHANGE: Added a warning message if GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT or GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS is not
set through export (Linux) or setx (Windows).

MINOR CHANGE: Added a switch to the log date and time format. It is now possible to switch
back to full date and time on each log line with "--log-dateformat 1". The short time only
format is still default with the value of 0.

MINOR CHANGE: Intensity maximum has been raised from 20 to 25. It doesn't seem to do much of a
difference above 20 for me, but others might have different experiences.

FLUFF: Change log is a little prettier now. Yes, I'll github it soon, I think. Soon(tm).


--- 2014-01-06 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGFIX: -g or --gpu-threads is now set to 1 by default. When I added the comma separating
code, I forgot to give it a default value. It is now 1 unless specified in the config file or
in the command line.


--- 2014-01-05 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAJOR CHANGE: -g or --gpu-threads now support comma separated values, yay!
It is exactly what it says, now you can finally put that Frankenrig configuration in one file.
The parameter follows the same design as gpu-engine and gpu-memclock.

MINOR CHANGE: I've reinstated display of intensity on GPU status lines. As a bonus I've also
added threads. I had removed intensity earlier because of lack of space, but now that accepted
and rejected got replaced with rejected percentage, there was suddenly plenty of room.

BUGFIX: Corrected the rejection percentage counter, thanks to Mikk36!
It was calculating the reject percentage out of the accepted shares only. Now it is fixed so
it calculates the reject percentage out of the total shares. The displayed rejection percentage
will be a little lower because of this, hooray for visual optimizations. :)


--- 2014-01-05 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAJOR CHANGE: Added program exit values for gpu-engine and gpu-memclock. This is only relevant
for mining rigs that are also used for other purposes. Like my gaming PC. :)

When my R9 290 is mining, it is running at 1000 engine and 1500 memclock. But when I am using
it for gaming, it runs 1117 engine and 1375 memclock. Normally I have to use a utility like
MSI AfterBurner or Sapphire TriXX to do so. But this change allows me to set an exit value
for each GPU when cgminer exits.

Above functionality as an example: --gpu-engine 1000:1117 --gpu-memclock 1500:1375

You can still combine it with multiple cards like this:
--gpu-engine 900,1000:1117 --gpu-memclock 1375,1500:1375
or this:
--gpu-engine 900:880,1000:1117 --gpu-memclock 1375:1250,1500:1375

Modified files: cgminer.c, adl.c, driver-opencl.c and miner.h


--- 2014-01-04 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLEANUP: Added dates to the change log. Future compiles will have a date appended and I'll
keep an archive of previous versions. Happy new year!


--- 2013-12-30 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE: Kevin's middlecoin fix, CURL TCP keepalive constants lowered:
CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPIDLE from 45 to 5 and CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPINTVL from 30 to 5.
Before it'd trigger a keepalive packet after 45 seconds of connection idle time and then again
every 30 seconds. Now it triggers a keepalive packet after 5 seconds of connection idle time and
then again every 5 seconds.

It makes the client more resilient against coin switching pools or just pools with connection
issues in general. It will however add a tiny bit pressure to the pool server; but a
TCP keepalive probe is only about 60-80 bytes, so I don't think it is an issue.
See util.c line 258 and 259.


--- 2013-12-28 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE: Included Alexey Karimov's scrypt130511.cl. It gave me around 2-3Kh/s more than the
original and every bit counts, no?! Requires AMD drivers 13.3 or later.


--- 2013-12-23 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE: Changed GPU status line from "A:xxxxx R:xxx" to "R:0.0%". It shows
(rejected/accepted)*100, which is the percentage of rejections for a GPU. Total accepted and
rejected in top status is unchanged. I'll probably add a toggle switch for it later, or
something.

MINOR CHANGE: Removed the intensity display on GPU status line in the ncurses window. It was
causing a broken line and screwed with the log view too.
See driver-opencl.c line 1306.


--- 2013-12-22 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FLUFF: Added a marquee effect to the three display separators.
When cgminer has been running for a while, the numbers rarely update - especially when working
on a high difficulty coin. The marquee effect adds a little movement to the screen, even if
nothing else changes. I'll probably add a toggle switch for it later, seeing as people will
eventually nag and bitch about it. :)


--- 2013-12-21 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAJOR BUGFIX: Fix to handle blank screen with blinking cursor.
It is a bug in adl.c, in the gpu_fanpercent() function, where some R9 290/290X cards return a
negative value for fan speed percentage, where earlier models returned the default value (usually
something like 33%). This triggers the protective code to believe the card has crashed and tries
to restart.

It's fixed by adding a variable that keeps track of the maximum fan speed percentage, and only
trigger above mentioned protective code if maximum fan speed was ever above the triggered value.
See adl.c line 470, 671 and 716, as well as miner.h line 330.

MAJOR BUGFIX: tkg's BSOD on exit fix.
https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=8859.msg78496#msg78496
In the adl.c file around line 472, add a line just before the ADL_Overdrive5_FanSpeed_Get call:
  ga->DefFanSpeedValue.iSpeedType=ADL_DL_FANCTRL_SPEED_TYPE_PERCENT;

CHANGE: Date removed from logging timestamp. Log now looks like:
 [23:59:57] Stratum from pool 0 detected new block
 [23:59:59] Accepted 389c47d1 Diff 1.16K/512 GPU 0 pool 0 
 [00:00:16] Log date is now 2013-12-22
 [00:00:16] Stratum from pool 0 detected new block
 [00:00:33] Accepted 7a4950a4 Diff 536/512 GPU 0 pool 0 

MINOR CHANGE: Pool retry after a broken connection is lowered from 5 minutes to one minute.
